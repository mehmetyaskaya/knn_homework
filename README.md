# knn_homework

The given files are created to complete the first homework of an introductory course on machine learning.

Download the files and open them using a Jupyter Notebook.

Do not forget to place the files in the same folder, otherwise, the functions inside knn.py will not be able to import analysis.ipynb.

Also, please note that the data is directly imported using its URL. If the website changes or the data is no longer available at the specified URL, the code will not work.

Have a good day!
